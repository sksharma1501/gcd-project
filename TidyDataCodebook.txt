Raw Data Set Information:
=========================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we 
captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments 
have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into 
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled 
in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into 
body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained 
by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ 
and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and 
gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter 
with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals 
were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, 
tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to 
indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Tidy Data Codebook for output.csv:
===================================
a) Column names: 
tBodyAcc-mean-X, tBodyAcc-mean-Y, tBodyAcc-mean-Z, tBodyAcc-std-X, tBodyAcc-std-Y, ....

Column names correspond to the mean and standard deviation variable names from the input data set. 
e.g. tBodyAcc-mean-X means time domain body acceleration mean in X axis.

b) Row names: 
X1.LAYING, X1.SITTING, X1.STANDING, X1.WALKING, X1.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, X1.WALKING_UPSTAIRS, ....

Row names indicate the subject and the activity pair. e.g. X1.LAYING means only measurements 
performed by subject 1 while doing the LAYING activity.

c) The tabular values indicate the average of particular variable for that activity performed by that 
subject. The units remain the same as the raw data set.
